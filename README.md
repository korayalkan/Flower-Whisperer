# FlowerWhisperer: A Garden of Neural Networks

Welcome to FloralVision, where the beauty of flowers meets the power of deep learning and image processing. In this repository, we've crafted a flower classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify five distinct flower species: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.

## Project Overview

Our objective is to build an intelligent system capable of precisely classifying flowers based on images. By employing advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, we've trained the model to recognize unique features of each flower type. The dataset is comprised of meticulously labeled images of Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip, enabling the model to learn and distinguish these beautiful blooms.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing

## Dataset Structure

- `daisy/`: Images of Daisy flowers
- `dandelion/`: Images of Dandelion flowers
- `rose/`: Images of Rose flowers
- `sunflower/`: Images of Sunflower flowers
- `tulip/`: Images of Tulip flowers

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repo_url]`
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory: `cd FloralVision`
3. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the model, and contribute to the development of FlowerWhisperer!
