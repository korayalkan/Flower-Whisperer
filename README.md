# FlowerWhisperer: A Garden of Neural Networks

Welcome to FloralVision, where the beauty of flowers meets the power of deep learning and image processing. In this repository, we've crafted a flower classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify five distinct flower species: Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip.

## Project Overview

Our objective is to build an intelligent system capable of precisely classifying flowers based on images. By employing advanced deep learning techniques and image processing, we've trained the model to recognize unique features of each flower type. The dataset is comprised of meticulously labeled images of Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower, and Tulip, enabling the model to learn and distinguish these beautiful blooms.

## Technologies Used

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Deep Learning
- Image Processing

## Access the Dataset
